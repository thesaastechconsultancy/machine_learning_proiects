## Real-World Project Catalogue for Machine and Deep Learning Problems

This repository provides supporting artifacts to http://neuron.thesaastech.com/ 

Showcasing real-world projects using machine and deep learning models. A project such as vehicle detection, personality classification, ChatBot, Stock price predictions, email spam detection, speech emotion recognization, house price prediction vehicle insurance prediction and many more. The objective here is to have well documented, end-2-end projects for supervised and unsupervised learning for different machine learning and artificial neural network models articulating the framework processes.
